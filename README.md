* Wish lists
* Ability to "follow" wishlists of friends
* User submitted comments on variety - share personal observations on growing style/needs for particular plants
* Data extraction for informational purposes such as variety popularity, "extinct" hybrids

Heavy influence is taken from Ravelry, in terms of user collection management in a social system
